        <h1>Who am I?</h1>

        <h2>My name is Jordan & heres a little about me</h2>

        <p>I was born and raised in Indianapolis, Indiana. I am 24 year's old, and the youngest of 3.</p> 
        <p>All my life I have loved to game on the computer. Fixing any problems I ran into on the computer 
           brought me some sort of joy.</p>
        <p>Even though I enjoy being on the computer, I also enjoy playing sports. 
           The true battle is trying to find the perfect balance between the both.</p>

        <h2>3 favorite things to do</h2>

            <li>Golf</li>

        </ul>
